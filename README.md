# Jeremy Dawson Personal Site

Static Astro site for Jeremy Dawson. The public site currently serves a short
temporary placeholder while the full professional site is being rewritten.

Current public-site checklist: `ROADMAP.md`

## Public documentation boundary

This repository contains public project documentation and reproducible
development information. Deployment details, credentials, monitoring
configuration, private operational notes, and environment-specific production
paths are intentionally excluded from public documentation.

## Status

This repo is public and intentionally conservative while the site is being
rewritten. The generated public site is only the placeholder homepage and
matching 404 page. No downloadable CV or resume is published from this repo.

## Commands

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run check`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check:base-path`
- `npm run check:guards`
- `npm run verify`
- `npm run preview`

`npm run check` runs Astro diagnostics. `npm run build` writes static output to
`dist/`. `npm run check:base-path` builds with a non-root `BASE_PATH` and
validates the generated links and metadata. `npm run check:guards` runs local
repository, CSS, and generated-output guards for the placeholder site. `npm run
verify` runs diagnostics, builds the site, and then runs those guards. No lint
script or separate test framework is currently configured.

Node 24 is recommended for local development and matches GitHub Actions. The
repository includes `.node-version` for tools that read it.

Optional build-time environment variables:

- `SITE_URL` overrides the canonical site URL used by Astro metadata and guard
  checks.
- `BASE_PATH` overrides the Astro base path for non-root previews or Pages
  project-site builds.
- `REPO_NAME` overrides GitHub repository-name inference when deriving a Pages
  base path in GitHub Actions. `GITHUB_ACTIONS` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` are read
  from the Actions environment when present.

## Content Editing

Active public copy lives in `src/data/profile.ts`, with the placeholder rendered
by `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/404.astro`. Prior full-site components,
animation code, and social-card assets are archived under `src/legacy-public/`
and are excluded from active type-checking and production output.

Only add public profile links, project details, or a downloadable CV/resume after
the destination or file is current, polished, and safe for broad public review.

## Deployment

The site builds as static Astro output. GitHub Pages deployment lives in
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and is currently manual-only via
`workflow_dispatch`. The manual deploy runs Astro diagnostics, builds static
output, and runs the local guard suite before uploading the Pages artifact.
Private production runbooks, DNS notes, monitoring details, and
environment-specific paths should stay out of public documentation.

The non-deploy check workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm run verify`
on pushes, pull requests, and manual dispatches. Dependabot is configured for npm
and GitHub Actions updates. `.npmrc` keeps public packages on npmjs and scopes
GitHub Packages to `@jerdaw` so Dependabot does not treat `npm.pkg.github.com`
as a replacement for the public npm registry.

Node type definitions intentionally stay on the Node 24 line while local
development and GitHub Actions use Node 24. Manual dependency changes should be
targeted and should avoid `npm audit fix --force`; keep the YAML override until
upstream dependencies resolve to a non-vulnerable `yaml` version without it.

## Windows / WSL Notes

`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are tracked as relative symlinks to `AGENTS.md`.
When this WSL repository is accessed through `\\wsl.localhost`, Windows Git may
report those links as modified even when their target is unchanged. Prefer WSL
Git for source-control operations in this repository.

The previous low-severity audit advisory in Astro's transitive `esbuild`
dev-server dependency on Windows was resolved by the Astro 7 upgrade. Keep local
dev servers bound to localhost unless a public network exposure is intentional.
The `yaml-language-server` YAML override remains intentional until upstream
dependencies resolve to a non-vulnerable `yaml` version without it.

### Remaining manual items

The remaining public-site tasks are tracked in `ROADMAP.md`.
