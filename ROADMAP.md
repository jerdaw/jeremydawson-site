# Site Roadmap

## Current Status

Phase: `Temporary public placeholder`

## What's Live

- Minimal Astro placeholder homepage for `https://jeremydawson.ca/`
- Matching temporary 404 page
- Placeholder copy sourced from `src/data/profile.ts`
- Manual GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- Legacy full-site public assets moved out of `public/` so they are not emitted in production builds
- No downloadable CV or resume published from this repo

## Remaining Tasks

Status key: `pending` · `optional`

### P1

- `pending` Rewrite the full public site around the medical school transition before expanding beyond the temporary placeholder.
- `pending` Finalize the master CV before adding any public PDF or downloadable resume link.
- `pending` Add verified ORCID, LinkedIn, GitHub, or other public profile links only after each destination is current and ready for broad public review.
- `pending` Decide which project, research, and career-history summaries should return to the public site.

### Polish / Visual

- `optional` Reintroduce the legacy timeline animation only if it fits the rewritten content.
- `optional` Add project or research entries as work becomes public.

### Maintenance

- `pending` Keep GitHub Pages deployment manual-only unless the site is ready for routine public updates again.
- `pending` Review the current Astro/Vite/esbuild and `@astrojs/check` / `yaml-language-server` audit advisories in a dependency-maintenance pass; avoid `npm audit fix --force` unless the breaking changes are reviewed.

## Notes

- Live URL: `https://jeremydawson.ca/`
- Public documentation intentionally excludes deployment runbooks, DNS notes, monitoring details, credentials, and environment-specific paths.
- The GitHub Pages workflow runs `npm run check` + `npm run build` only when manually dispatched. Browser/Playwright-style checks should stay in GitHub CI if added later.
